%% =============================== ABSTRACT ====================================

\begin{abstract}
  Future Earth-observing systems will involve distributed missions of autonomous
and heterogeneous spaceborne sensor networks.  New systems will occupy a more
complex decision space and will be capable of adaptive decisions and
collaborative networking.  These capabilities must be utilized to increase a
network's operational value and to optimize autonomous high-level communications
decisions.  Developing the required technology for both ground operations and
space deployment may be greatly accelerated by machine learning techniques and
cognitive communications algorithms.  The following research describes the
development and analysis of simulated sensor networks which employ a cognitive
communications model.  Results from these simulations provide training data for
machine learning models which are used to explore the expanded decision space.

%% ============================= INTRODUCTION ==================================

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

It is envisioned that NASA's future space systems will be composed of large,
inhomogeneous networks of small satellites and autonomous platforms.  These
resource constrained systems, carrying an array of different instruments, will
be expected to operate autonomously and collaboratively to achieve mission and
science goals.  Unfortunately, current and near-future inter-satellite
communications are highly constrained in terms of link availability,
reliability, power and bandwidth.  Although future technologies (such as free
space optical links) may alleviate some constraints, it is expected that future
instruments will rapidly expand in both data volume and sensor
reconfigurability.  In this way, it is not sufficient to simply increase the
capabilities of the communication links.  Rather, it is also necessary to
improve the complex decision making that communication systems perform, such as
deciding when to transmit, what information is valuable to nodes of the network,
and how to adapt local operations following the reception of new information.

Recently, cognitive space communication algorithms have been proposed as a
solution to address the complexity of future inter-satellite communication
systems.  Typically, these cognitive algorithms have tried to address
communications at a low level and include decision making regarding modulation,
power and bandwidth, and error rate.  However, it is reasonable to expect that
cognition may also offer an improvement in the complex, higher level decisions
of communication in the context of mission and science objectives.  At this
level, cognition is applied to the operation of the network with the decision
making primarily influenced by the constraints of the space communication
network links.

In this work, we show results of simulation studies to explore the advantages
that cognition could offer for collaborative small-satellite networks.  Under a
NASA Advanced Information System Technology program, we are currently developing
an open-source \cpp library for the simulation of autonomous and collaborative
networks of adaptive sensors.  This library and accompanying utilities allow for
the efficient simulation of networks of satellites with realistic constraints in
communication, power, and measurements.  A key focus of this software is the
simulation of sensors that operate adaptively.  Adaptive sensors must make
intelligent decisions regarding their configuration based on their own
measurements as well as the measurements provided by other sensors in a network.
However, the extreme complexity of the decision space makes the development of
optimal decision-making systems very difficult.  Thus, an approach based on
cognition could offer an appealing solution.  We investigate how our simulation
tools could be useful for production of large training datasets that capture the
operation of collaborative, adaptive networks of small satellites.  We then
investigate how such a dataset could be combined with machine learning
techniques to train neural networks that could make intelligent decisions about
when and what to communicate.  Results from our investigation will be presented,
and the applicability of these methods to future cognitive space communication
will be discussed.

Machine learning provides computers the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed.  Such intelligent machines are capable of accurately
predicting and classifying new data.  Computers can be programmed to learn
autonomously with or without supervision, and often require significant
quantities of training data and careful adjustment of model parameters.  These
techniques are useful for the problems which: require many manual adjustments or
long lists of rules; operate in a fluctuating environment; need to process a
large amount of data; or have no known optimal solution.

Machine learning techniques are currently being applied in the development of
adaptive hardware, resource optimization, and other areas of sensor network
design.  An opportunity exists to use machine learning to optimize information
flow within a collaborative network of satellites.  Improvements would increase
communications efficiency by increasing the value of data contents and reducing
operational resource consumption.

All of the common machine learning algorithms apply to optimization of
high-level communication parameters.  Regression tasks enable satellites to
autonomously adjust parameters for communication, sensing, and on-board data
processing.  Classification of network nodes based on proximity and capabilities
could increase efficiency by informing antenna direction or temporal scheduling.
This research involves the application of new and existing machine learning
algorithms.  Existing algorithms are widely available as third-party Python
modules, and will be discussed later in Section~\ref{sec:software}.  Custom
algorithms are developed for the \cpp library.

\subsection{Cognitive Communications}
\label{ssec:cognit}

A cognitive entity is capable of taking action based on its goals and perception
of the environment, potentially learning from the result of its action.  It is
an intelligent entity which posesses perception, learning, reasoning, and making
decisions.  In the current context, cognitive communication involves the
intelligent routing of information within an autonomous satellite sensor network
for collaborative improvement in mission science return.  This concept adds
collaboration to ``adaptive remote sensing'' and feedback to traditional
inter-satellite ``communication''.

%% =============================== SOFTWARE ====================================

\section{Sensor Network Simulations to Support Machine Learning Research}
\label{sec:software}

Research in applying machine learning to sensor networks will rely on
simulations to validate algorithms both deployed on spacecraft and on the
ground.  Simulations must provide the means for basic cognitive communication as
well as the production of training data for post-processing by neural networks.
Training data should include simulation variables which are suspected of
correlation to the parameter being optimized.  Variables may capture time-series
data involving satellite position, health, communication hardware details,
sensor hardware details, network connectivity, or other similar parameters.

A software tool-set \project is under development which is capable of producing
the described training data.  The toolset has two main components: first, a \cpp
development library for observing system simulation experiments; and second, a
Python visualization and analysis package for post-processing of data.  The
project is published to a Git repository under the GPLv3.0 license.

The \project library offers a number of unique features valuable to future
observing system simulation experiments.  At its core, it is a physics engine
for satellite position, velocity, and attitude.  Power and RF accessories may be
attached to satellites and individually oriented.  The next level involves rapid
constellation design.  Standard orbit models described by two-line-element (TLE)
sets are provided, copied, and modified to generate novel and interesting
constellation patterns.  Examples are illustrated in Fig.1(a).

Sensor hardware is attached to satellites as an interface to truth data (NetCDF
Nature Run data).  This provides a custom modeling environment for real sensor
hardware and enables heterogeneous sensor constellations with different
capabilities.  As a satellite orbits, its pointing vector intersects Earth's
surface or an atmospheric layer and samples the underlying data, as shown in
Fig.1(b-d).

\project is named for its ability to manage collaborative networks of
satellites.  Its implementation focuses on the high-level communication decision
space previously discussed.  The library employs, in addition to standard \cpp
components, advanced data structures including trees and graphs to execute
predictive route-finding algorithms for efficient communications.  For example,
line-of-sight wireless channels are captured in a graph, as illustrated in
Fig.1(e), the minimum spanning tree.

A predictive scheduling algorithm is illustrated in Fig.1(f).  Satellite ``A''
measures cloud depth in the Pacific Ocean (blue line).  It then predicts the
arrival of a follow-up satellite and relays a message through satellites ``B''
and ``C'' to queue ``D'' for a measurement with a different sensor (red line).
Significant work has been done to optimize this algorithm, because it is the
main consumer of CPU time and is run regularly in simulation to find routes.  It
is also the foundation for deployed cognitive communications, as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:examples}.

Presently, the included algorithms are iterative and often take minutes to
conclude.  It may be possible to reduce run-time or optimize routes based on
alternative parameters using machine learning.  An option is to replace these
algorithms with predictive neural networks for advanced regression or
classification algorithms.  \project facilitates this by producing data
in standard formats for post-processing.

  \label{fig:data}
\end{figure}

The software logs simulation data to files accessible by external machine
learning tools.  \project was developed around simple data formats for
portability and to promote development of custom analysis tools.  Primarily,
data is serialized and written to binary files.  These formats are well
documented and easy to parse in Python or other scripting languages.  Included
Python packages understand the data formats and can read and store the data for
later use as Numpy or Pandas data structures.  Examples include time-series data
frames or network adjacency matrices (weighted and unweighted).  Fig.2
shows several common data structures in memory.

Python scripts are provided not only for receiving simulation data at a low
level, but also many high level analysis tasks.  In fact, all figures in this
document were produced using the tools provided by the library.  Primary
third-party packages used include the following: Numpy, Pandas, Cython, NetCDF4,
Matplotlib, Cartopy, Scikitlearn, TensorFlow, and SciPy.  These enable post
processing for plots and animations or to train machine learning algorithms.
Numpy and Pandas provide powerful linear algebra and statistics operations.
Cartopy provides extensive map projections and transformations which support
visualizing satellite positions and truth data.  Machine learning algorithms are
available in the Scikitlearn and Tensorflow packages, which interface well with
Numpy and Pandas structures.

For example, satellite parameter data (Fig.2(a)) is plotted in Fig.3(a) to
expose and potentially exploit correlations.  Several of these seem strongly
correlated and many are also periodic.  Potential high-level communications
optimizations may involve predicting when a satellite has the most visible
neighbors (available line-of-sight links).  An algorithm for power management
scheduling may use the instantaneous charge or power to plan efficient sensor
operation.

Another visualization involves network structure.  Fig.3(b) and (c) contain
plots of unweighted and weighted adjacency matrices.  A built-in Python library
called NetworkX produced these graphs and works well with the adjacency matrix
format.
